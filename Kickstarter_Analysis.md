# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
The Challenge "Kickstarter" is essentially a data analytics project which aims to provide the stakeholder, Louise, with actionable information that will enable her to plan a successful funding campaign.  Our Analysis in this report will assess the outcomes of past campaigns and the factors influencing campaign outcomes. In addition, limitations of the data provided will also be communicated through this report to aid Louise in drawing well-informed conclusions.

## Purpose
To provide Louise with tools that will replicate the success of past campaigns is the primary focus of this Report.


## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
The line chart that we generated from the charts tab portrays the influence of the launch date on the outcomes of various compaigns since 2015. The X-Axis and Y-Axis represents the "Count of Outcomes" and "Months of the year" respectively. The representations of the coloured lines are as listed below:
 * Blue: Successful Campaigns
 * Orange: Failed Campaigns 
 * Grey: Cancelled Campaigns


Although this chart provides a lot of information, two important information stand out. 
 * The month of May has the most number of successfull campaigns. This probably because of the genreal outlook of the public surrounding this season. It is during the spring that people are more than happy to induldge in leisure activities. This information is vital for Lousise's sheduling.
